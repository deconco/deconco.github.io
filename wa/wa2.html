        <p>Connor Cook | he/him</p>
        <p>5th year biology and media studies major, doing a minor in CTD.</p>
        <p>My goals for this course are to become fluent in the languages (programming and otherwise) that run the web. My dad taught me how to make bare-bones HTML websites, and now I want to make them <strong>look good</strong> and have <strong>cool interactive functions!</strong></p>
        <h3>A few things I'd love to learn how to do...</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Add background music to pages</li>
            <li>Embed playable videos</li>
            <li>Use images as links - interactive gallery pages</li>
            <li>Design websites that are both functional and cute!</li>
        </ul>
