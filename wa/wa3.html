    <p>Knitted textiles survive from as early as the 11th century CE, but the first substantive evidence of crocheted fabric emerges in Europe during the 19th century.
        Earlier work identified as crochet was commonly made by n√•lebinding, a different looped yarn technique.
        There are three main theories for the origin of crochet.
        Some believe that its beginnings can be traced to the Arab trade route, originating in Arabia and spreading to Tibet and then Spain as well as other Mediterranean countries.
        The second theory places crochet in South America where it was used as adornment in a primitive tribe's puberty ritual.
        The third notes the use of crochet in China where early examples of dolls were worked entirely in crochet.</p>
